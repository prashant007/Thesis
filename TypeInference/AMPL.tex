\section {Sequential Abstract Machine for MPL (SAMPL)}
{\em SAMPL} acts as the target to which the sequntial MPL compiles and is subsequently run. {\em SAMPL} is inspired by {\em modern-SEC Machine}  which in turn was inspired by Landin's SECD machine. However, there are a few differences between {\em SAMPL} and {\em modern-SEC Machine}, the most notable one of which are the following :-
 \begin{itemize}
   \item {\em SAMPL} is a more sophisticated machine as it has built in {\em data types} and {\em codata types} where as {\em modern-SEC Machine} lacks these constructs.
   \item {\em modern-SEC Machine} uses {\em strict evaluation} strategy for the execution of programs. In contrast, {\em SAMPL} uses a mixture of two strategies for program reduction, namely {\em lazy evaluation} when handling {\em records} of a {\em codata type} and {\em strict evaluation} strategy when reducing other MPL constructs.
 \end{itemize}

 \subsection {Evaluation Strategies}


~~\\~~\\ 
{\em SAMPL} is described in terms of a state transition table which guides an  
~~\\~~\\ 
Recall that AMPL is represented as a four tuple $\{S,T,E,C\}$ of {\em Stack}, {\em Translation}, {\em Environment} and {\em Code}. However, {\em Translation} can be removed from the tuple while discussing {\em SAMPL}. There 



The major differences between {\em modern-SECD Machine} and {\em SAMPL} is are the following :-

\begin{itemize}
   \item {\em modern-SEC Machine} uses De-Bruijn's indexes to lookup values in an environment. However,
